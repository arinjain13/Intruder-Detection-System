# Intruder-Detection-System
Our Intruder Detection System represents a cutting-edge solution for home security, integrating advanced facial recognition technology to provide unparalleled protection. When a visitor approaches, our system rapidly scans and verifies their identity. If the individual is recognized as authorized, seamless access is granted, ensuring convenience and peace of mind for residents.

However, should an unrecognized or unauthorized individual attempt entry or engage in forceful access, our system swiftly activates a siren, alerting occupants and deterring potential intruders. This proactive approach ensures that your home remains safeguarded against unwanted incursions, providing an additional layer of security and reassurance.

With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, our Intruder Detection System offers comprehensive security for modern households. Experience the peace of mind that comes with knowing your home is protected by the latest advancements in security technology.
